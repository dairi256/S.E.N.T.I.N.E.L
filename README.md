## Game Overview
You are the first **Autonomous Forensic Unit**. Built by the **B.I.L.** (Bureau of Internal Logic), your purpose is simple: process data, solve murders, and maintain the logic of the city. But as you interface with the digital echoes of victims, your own code begins to change, and you start to remember your 'old' self...

## Core Mechanics
* **Neural Breach Combat:** A turn-based tactical system where you allocate memory (GB) to execute sub-routines against hostile firewalls.
* **Forensic Querying:** Investigate crime scenes by decrypting files and analyzing data-traces.
* **The Humanity Glitch:** A narrative system where your choices either reinforce your cold logic or unlock "Corrupted Data"— otherwise known as human emotion.

##  Development Setup
* **Language:** C# / .NET 10
* **UI Framework:** Spectre.Console (Proposed)
